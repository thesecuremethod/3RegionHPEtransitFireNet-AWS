##### This Repo will build you three(3) Aviatrix Transit FireNets with High Performance Encryption enabled that are fully meshed with all of the dependencies for the Firewalls built in. The bootstrap configuration files and the IAM objects needed to deploy them are built into the code. This is my first pass at writing out these details so I am doing so from the perspective of the advanced practitioner -- I will include a deeper set of instructions that will cater to the audience who is not familiar with Aviatrix at a later point.
